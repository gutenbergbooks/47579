<p class="drop-cap">THE air is an elastic fluid surrounding
the earth. The
motions of things whether
alive or not, set it in a state
of vibration that rarely ceases. At all
times and in all places it is pulsing
responsively to all that is going on.</p>

<p>Animals are interested in what is
moving about them. It may mean
life or death, pleasure or agony, and
most animals are keen to know which
is for them at any given period. They
are therefore equipped with organs
that respond to these waves of the air.
They are variously equipped, some
hearing certain sounds feebly where
others are acute to them and deeply
moved. Some sounds are full of
moment to one organism arousing it
to nervous activity while another
organism knows nothing of what is so
distinctly heard by the first.</p>

<p>Can a Mule hear more than a
Mouse is a question which has agitated
many young people who have considered
the length of the former's ear
and its versatility. A series of experiments
once conducted in youthful
sport by the writer, seemed to settle
the matter that each can hear sounds
which are unnoticed by the other, and
that the ear of the Mouse is much
better adapted in hearing powers to
the occupation of the Mouse than is
that of his long eared neighbor. Certain
shrill sounds of whatever degree
of loudness, cannot be heard by the
Mule even when oats might be secured
by attending to them, while distant
sounds of a heavy character seem to
fail to affect the ear of the Mouse.</p>

<p>The same is noticeable in the hearing
of people. To some persons a note
one octave higher than the highest
note of a piano, cannot be heard.
Others can hear such a tone, and yet
others are made painfully nervous by
it without knowing quite what the
trouble is. To some the chirp of the
Sparrow is the upper limit of hearing,
others can hear the voice of the Bat,
yet others are able to hear the notes of
insects that range higher in pitch
than the voice of the Bat. Dr. Wollaston
says, "As there is nothing in the
nature of the atmosphere to prevent
the existence of vibrations incomparably
more frequent than any of which
we are conscious, we may imagine
that animals like the Grilli (Grasshoppers)
whose powers appear to
commence nearly where ours terminate,
may have the faculty of hearing
still sharper sounds which we do not
know to exist; and that there may be
other insects, hearing nothing in
common with us, but endowed with a
power of exciting, and a sense which
perceives vibrations of the same nature,
indeed, as those which constitute our
ordinary sounds, but so remote that
the animals who perceive them may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
said to possess another sense agreeing
with our own solely in the medium by
which it is excited."</p>

<p>The human ear is capable of hearing
musical sounds produced by vibrations
ranging from twenty-four in a
second of time to forty thousand.
This indicates that humanity is confined
in interest to the motions of the
atmosphere within these limits. The
possibilities of higher and lower fields
of music are such that one writer has
said that it may be that the air about
us is constantly resounding to the
music of the heavenly hosts while our
dull ears with their limited powers are
unable to catch the poorest note in
that celestial harmony.</p>

<p>Sound travels about one thousand
ninety feet in a second in the air.
Through other elastic mediums it
varies in speed. The beholder of an
explosion of dynamite in a harbor
receives three shocks, one coming by
way of the air, another by water, and
the third through the earth, all
arriving at different times.</p>

<p>It is a fortunate thing that low
sounds travel as rapidly as high ones
and loud sounds no faster than soft
ones. Thus the playing of a band
upon the water, at a distance, is beautiful,
because all the tones powerful
enough to reach the listener do so at
the right time to preserve harmony.
If it were not for this equality in
traveling power, no music on a grand
scale could be possible, for those sitting
at a distance from the performers would
be in a sea of discord from the late
arrival of tones which should have
blended with those gone before. In spite
of the fact that our highest appreciable
note is but one-third of an inch in
length of wave and the wave of our
lowest note exceeds forty feet in length,
all sounds produced in harmony travel
in harmony till exhausted in space.</p>

<p>The ears of various animals are beautifully
adapted to their respective
habits. The watch of the Dog is most
valuable because distant noises are so
readily detected by his faithful ear.
The Thrush has been observed hopping
along the ground with frequent
stops to listen. So keen is his hearing
that the presence of a Worm below the
surface is detected by the sound of the
Worm's occupation. By judiciously
beating the ground he brings the
Worm toward the surface as if to
escape its enemy, the Mole. At the
proper instant the turf is torn up and
nearly always the Worm secured.</p>

<p>The form of the outer ear is adapted
to the needs of the animal. Most
grass eating animals have ears that
turn readily in all directions to listen
for enemies, but the ears of flesh eating
animals that pursue their prey are set
only to reach forward to hear the
sounds of escaping prey.</p>

<p>Many insects and lower orders of
animals are looked upon by man as
incapable of the pleasures of hearing.
But this is often a mistake. Snails
have been known to enjoy the voice of
their human friends and come forth
when called by familiar voices.</p>

<p>The fondness of the Cobra for music
and the powers of charming this
hideous animal partly by appealing to
his esthetic hearing are well known.
Moths have good hearing as one may
observe while walking in the woods
where the crackling of dry sticks
alarms them so they fly up from their
noonday slumbers in great numbers.
The antennæ of the Butterfly are
supposed to act as hearing organs.
Crabs and Shrimps hear with their
inner antennæ, Clams with their feet,
and some of the crustacea with the
bases of the lobe of the tail.</p>

<p>Many animals seem to enjoy the
voice of man and the sounds of the
various musical instruments which he
uses. Frogs and Toads may be taught
to know their master's voice. Canaries,
Parrots, and Doves enjoy human singing
and instrumental music as well.
A Woodchuck has been known to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
manifest his refinement of soul by
coming forth from his hole at the
sound of a piano and to sit with the
air of a connoisseur criticising the
selections with which he was being
favored.</p>

<p>Not only is the ability to hear different
in different persons, but the
thoroughness with which they hear
varies largely. Few sounds consist of
simple waves of air. As the waves of
the sea are noticed to bear smaller
waves upon them and these in turn to
carry wavelets, so the waves of sound
are rarely smooth, simple waves.
There are many more waves upon
waves in sound production than can
be observed on the surface of the sea.
A note from the piano not only sounds
the note which the key struck represents,
but also a great many tones that
chord with this tone higher up the
scale. These overtones are not so loud
as the fundamental tone and cannot
readily be detected by the uncultivated
ear. But they give character to the
tone. The overtones make the note
of the violin and the cornet differ.
No two voices have the same overtones,
and while we are unable to hear
these overtones by themselves, yet we
are able to distinguish the voices of
our friends instantly by means of them.</p>

<p>As voices differ in the overtones
they carry, so do ears differ in the
number of overtones they are able to
receive. Some people enjoy hearing
high voices only. For them the
soprano or tenor is always in demand.
Others prefer deep voices and admire
altos and basses. I have stood beside
a friend at a concert where a first class
artist was pouring forth a baritone
song with the most delicate and artistic
tone and finish, and had my friend
turn to me and say: "What on earth
do people find in that man's voice to
pay money to hear?" The singer's
voice was full of rich overtones which
made it valuable to the average cultured
listener, but in the ear of my
friend they produced a jarring that
was decidedly unpleasant to him, although
he was fond of the singing of
the untrained voices of the members
of the choir where he attended church.</p>

<p>A large part of the business of the
voice culture expert is the adjustment
of the vocal organs in singing so as to
produce the right sets of overtones to
give the voice a carrying quality and
the richness we enjoy in the finished
artist. One notable example of the
production of too much of a good thing
was instanced in the fate of a soprano
who came to America a few years ago
with an extensive operatic repertoire
and a voice that could not be drowned
by a full orchestra as it soared to the
greatest heights and displayed a flexibility
most remarkable. But she
failed to please us. A neighbor of
mine said to her friend: "Just wait till
you hear Madame Blank begin. She
has a voice that will cut you like a
knife."</p>

<p>Both the inner and outer ear formations
are responsible for the differences
in hearing in different people. Cultivation
does much for any sense, but
for him that has no ear for music
cultivation will not construct an ear.
It is easy to see what a difference in
hearing will be produced by a slight
change in the position of the outer ear.
While listening to a steady sound,
draw the ear forward with one finger,
relax it to its normal position, then
push it back against the head. The
quality of the sound heard and its
intensity will be varied in each
instance.</p>

<p>So we may be lenient with our
friends who do not enjoy the same sort
of music with ourselves. And the
same music will not always be the
very same. A pistol shot upon a
mountain top sounds much like a fire
cracker in a valley, and the condition
of the atmosphere frequently modifies
music almost as much as the shape of
the room in which it is produced.</p>

  THE KINGBIRD OF PARADISE.</h2>


<p>Wouldn't you little folks like
to see a number of us brilliant,
gem-like Birds of Paradise flitting
among the trees as do your
Robins and Woodpeckers and
Jays? To see us spreading our
wings in the sun, and preening
our ruby and emerald and topaz
and amethyst tinted plumes, ribbons,
and streamers?</p>

<p>Ah, that would be an astonishing
sight, but you will have
to journey to an island in the
South Pacific Ocean to see that;
an island whose shores are
bathed by a warm sea, and where
the land is covered with the most
luxuriant tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>It was about three hundred
years ago that the people of
Europe first knew that such
superb birds existed on this
earth. Traders visited one of
the Malayan islands in search of
cloves and nutmegs, and upon
leaving, the natives presented
them with a few dried skins of
a wonderfully beautiful bird.
The natives called them "God's
Birds," and in order to propitiate
heaven for killing them, cut off
the feet of the dead birds and
buried them beneath the tree
upon which they were found.</p>

<p>The dried bodies of the birds
were exported as time went on,
and as the people of Europe had
never seen one alive, but always
the skin without legs and feet,
they came to consider them as
heavenly birds, indeed, formed
to float in the air as they dwelt in
the Garden of Eden, resting
occasionally by suspending
themselves from the branches of
trees by the feathers of their
tails, and feeding on air, or the
soft dews of heaven. Hence they
called us the <span class="sc">Birds of Paradise</span>.</p>

<p>It was not till one hundred
years after, when a writer and
collector of birds visited the
island, and spent years in watching
and studying us, that the
truth became known. Certainly,
the gentleman must have
laughed, when, instead of heavenly
dew, he saw a <span class="sc">Bird of
Paradise</span> catch a Grass-hopper
and holding it firmly by his
claws, trim it of wings and
legs, then devour it, head first.
Fruit and insects of all kinds
we eat instead of dew and air.</p>

<p>He also saw a party of twenty
or thirty males dancing on the
branches of huge trees, raising
their wings, stretching out their
necks and elevating their plumes
all for the purpose of admiring
themselves or being admired.
Some of them have finer plumage
than I, but only the <span class="sc">Kingbirds
of Paradise</span> have those two dear
little rings which you see in my
picture.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sublime is no nearer the
ridiculous in literature than in
the things of nature. An
instance of this is the close
relation of the common Crow to the
most glorious bird of them all. Not
only are they very much alike in
general form, including shape of feet,
bill, bones, and ordinary feathering, but
also in habit. They seem to delight in
the same sorts of food and secure it in
much the same manner. When they
are happiest and attempt to pour forth
their songs of joy the voice of the Crow
is fully as melodious and satisfactory
to the human ear as is that of the Bird
of Paradise.</p>

<p>The old fable in regard to their
having no feet and living only on the
dews of heaven and the delicacies
which they were supposed to be able
to collect from the atmosphere as they
floated perpetually free from the earth
and its contaminations was so grateful
to Europeans that when Antony Pigafetta,
who accompanied Magellan
around the world and secured a great
deal of information at first hand,
described them as birds with very
ordinary, in fact, almost ugly, feet and
legs, he was not believed, and Aldrovandus
publicly brought accusations
against him for audacious falsehood.</p>

<p>While the males have not only a
splendid growth of delicate floating
feathers of very unusual length
and glossy fineness of texture, the
females have but little more to boast
of than our American Crow, and they
even lack the degree of lustre which
our black friend frequently exhibits.
But the males are adorned with a
wealth of color display, rich in velvety
softness and blazing with metallic
lustre. This lustre cannot be appreciated
from the appearance of the faded
specimens so often seen in the museums
which may have suffered, not alone
from dust and exposure for years to the
chemical action of light but have also
been sadly diminished in glory by the
rude arts of the natives who fumigate
the skins with burning sulphur, their
principal care seeming to be to get
enough of it deposited to make sure of
the skins' not being attacked by insects.</p>

<p>To be seen to best advantage one
needs to watch them as they make their
short migrations in flocks from one
island to another with the change of
the seasons from the dry to the wet
monsoon. They prefer traveling against
the wind rather than with it because
their plumage is so elaborate and delicate
in its structure that an attempt to
fly with the wind frequently brings
disaster to the glorious males and
causes them to tumble ignominiously
to the ground, after which they are a
long time in arranging affairs for
another attempt at navigation of the
air.</p>

<p>The King Bird of Paradise is a small
bird, measuring but little over six inches
in length. It is extremely vivacious,
flying about and running with but
little show of the dignity of its family.
Very fond of fruits, it is not satisfied
with attacking those which other birds
of its size would choose, but enjoys
showing its gormandizing powers by
devouring as much as possible of the
largest specimens within its reach.</p>

<p>The fan-shaped tuft of feathers which
adorns each side of the bird are subject
to his will, being raised and spread out
or lowered as the weather or the feelings
of the bird seem to demand. At
the ends of the long feather shafts
springing from its tail are markings
which strongly resemble the eye-like
ornaments of the Peacock. The shafts
seem not content with stretching themselves
out to a greater length than that
of the bird itself, but at the extremities
they curve inward coiling compactly
into spiral discs flashing with emerald
green.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PECCARY" id="THE_PECCARY"></a>THE PECCARY.</h2>


<p>Looks very much like a little
Pig, does'nt he, children? Well,
so he is, a species of wild pig
found in the canebrakes of
Texas, and native of South
America.</p>

<p>You would hardly think so
small an animal could be so
ferocious, but the inhabitants of
South America dread and fear
him as much as they do the Wild
Boar. He is a fearless little
creature, too, attacking any object
which comes in his way no
matter how big it is. Even an
Elephant wouldn't scare him,
though, as Elephants are not
found in South America or
Texas, I presume a Peccary
never saw one.</p>

<p>His jaws, as you see, are armed
with tusks, like those of the
Boar, but they are straight
instead of curved, are sharp at
the edges, and although no
longer than your finger can
inflict a terrible wound on account
of the great strength of
the animal's neck.</p>

<p>When a body of them charge
an enemy they will fight till
every one of them is slain.
You will not wonder then that
Men, Horses, and Dogs fly at
the approach of a herd of
Peccaries, the poor Horses being
so easily brought down by
having their legs cut to pieces
by the sharp tusks.</p>

<p>In the canebrakes of Texas,
where the trees are of enormous
size, the Peccaries make their
home. A fallen tree overgrown
with thickets of the cane, matted
together with strong and thorny
vines, is their favorite lodging.
Into one of these hollow logs a
drove of twenty or thirty will
enter at night, each one backing
in, the last one to enter standing
with his nose to the entrance
and acting as sentinel.</p>

<p>On dark, drizzly days they
never leave their lodgings, and
it is on these days that the
farmers who have suffered by
their ravages on grain-crop and
stock, succeed in putting an end
to many of their enemies. As
soon as daylight appears and
the protruding snout and watchful
eyes of the sentinel on duty
can be seen, a sharp report of a
rifle is heard; with a spring the
sentinel leaps out and soon rolls
lifeless upon the ground. Instantly
a low grunt is heard,
and another snout and sharp
pair of eyes appear in the
opening. A flash, a report, and
out he leaps to his death, also;
thus they go on till every
"lodger" is disposed of.</p>

<p>Of all animals the Peccary
alone, it is said, resists the terror
of the gun, its flash and report
serving only to enrage him.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS interesting animal, which
is of common occurrence
throughout the forests of
South America, roams through
the woods in large herds and is constantly
migrating, being often driven
by scarcity of food to make long
journeys. Rendgger, the well known
naturalist, states that one may follow
the Peccaries for days without seeing
them. In their wanderings they keep
to the open country, which ordinarily
they rarely frequent, and even streams
cannot stop them. If they reach a
field they cross it at a run, and if they
arrive at the banks of a river they
do not hesitate but swim at once
across it.</p>

<p>They have been seen crossing the
Paraguay river at a place where it
requires about a half hour to do so.
The herd keeps together in a close
throng, the males in advance, each
mother having her young behind her.
The noise made by the animals can be
heard a long distance, not only on
account of the dull, hoarse sounds
which they make, but still more by
reason of the cracking of the dead
branches which they break in their
impetuous progress.</p>

<p>Both day and night the Peccaries
search for food. They eat all kinds
of arboreal fruit and roots, and their
teeth are so strong that they can easily
open the hardest of palm seeds. They
often do great mischief to the crops.
Besides vegetable food they are said
also to eat Snakes, Lizards, Worms, and
Grubs, in this respect being useful animals.
They are much more cleanly
in their habits than the Wild Boars,
and Beehm asserts that they never eat
more than they require, and seek water
only during periods of the most intense
heat, and then they wallow only
in pools. During the day they hide
in tree trunks, in which they sleep
also at night.</p>

<p>The female gives birth to a single
young one, in rare instances to two.
The cry of the young is like that of
Goats. They are easily tamed and
domesticated if treated well. The flesh
is eaten by the poorer classes, the skin
being chiefly used for bags and thongs.
On account of a gland which the
animal bears in its haunches and which
has an evil effect on the meat, causing
it to become unfit for use in a very
short time, the flesh is not considered
to be particularly excellent.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Peccary is
totally devoid of fear. It is small,
rarely exceeding eighteen inches in
height, and yet it is not less dreaded
than the most savage Wild Boar would
be. Many an unlucky sportsman, to
escape a herd of these wild creatures
has been glad to climb a tree in time
to save his life. Men, Horses, and
Dogs fly in haste, for the Peccaries
fight like a well drilled army, and by
swarming about an enemy they are
sure to conquer with their strong, sharp
tusks. They avoid conflict with man,
and shyly run into the thick woods on
his approach, but when fired upon or
brought to bay they seem possessed
only with rage and desire for vengeance.</p>

<p>The Peccary is peculiar in his
anatomy, having several sacs in place
of a single stomach, thus resembling
the cud chewing animals. This
resemblance is traced still further in
the feet, where the metacarpal and
metatarsal bones of the two greater
toes are united into a sort of cannon
bone.</p>

<p>This specimen came from the canebrakes
of Texas.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE summer wanes; the days
grow shorter and the evenings
longer, heralding the advent
of Autumn, and the woods
and fields are mellowing under the
genial glow of the sun. All Nature
is taking on a warmer tinge, gladdening
the eye with its fullness of
beauty&mdash;rich in the promise of
autumnal harvest.</p>

<p>It is a sad fact, but none the less
true that a great many of us go
through life with unseeing eyes. Why
must we be <i>taught</i> to see the beauties
around us? What a tale might be
told by the little flower that we pass
carelessly by, or tread upon in our
haste; if we would but listen!</p>

<p>There is beauty everywhere&mdash;in the
early dawning when the iris-tinted
morning-glories are radiant with glittering
dew drops; when the sun is
high overhead; when the soft twilight
has enveloped the land in its mantle
of calm; whether the rain is falling
or whether the skies are blue and
sunny beauty is everywhere.</p>

<p>"How strikingly the course of
Nature tells by its light heed of human
suffering that it was fashioned for a
happier world!" Listen to the songs
of happy birds. How care-free! How
joyously they outpour from over-flowing
little throats their God-given
melodies of love and gladness! Is not
the world brighter and better for their
being?</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Overhead in the maple a little life
was struggling for being. It was only
a pebble thrown by a thoughtless boy
"to see if he could hit it," but the
cruel act was done, and the little
songster, the happy bird whose early
morning matins together with the
carolings of his mate, had greeted us
all through the summer lay in the
little nest greviously wounded. The
hurried, distressed movements of his
little mate told of her anxiety to do
what she could for the sufferer. She
seemed to know it would not be long,
now,&mdash;that he would never sing with
her again.</p>

<p>After awhile everything was still in
the maple bough. It was growing
dark as we softly approached the nest,
and we thought the remaining bird
had flown away. It had not, however,
for as the inquisitive face of our little
girl peeped into the leafy retreat we
heard a rustle of wings, and the bird
flew out from its place of repose.
Perhaps she was watching the little
dead form of her mate, sure that her
vigil would be rewarded and that he
would greet her in the morning with
love as he had done for so long.
Who knows?</p>

<p>Next day we buried the little martyr
and the other bird went away. She
has not returned since, but the nest
still remains in the old place. The
boy who had done the mischief went
on his way unconscious of the thing
he had done, but</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DOLPHINS, according to the
best authorities, inhabit
all oceans, and undertake
great migrations, but are
the only Whales which
frequent the rivers or even spend their
whole lives in them, or in the lakes
connected with them. They are all
gregarious, some of them collecting in
very large shoals, and roaming about
the sea together for weeks and weeks.
Their liveliness, playfulness, and lack
of shyness have earned them the
friendship of sailors and poets from
the remotest ages.</p>

<p>The Bottle-nose Dolphin is one of the
best known members of the family.
The snout is very long, like a beak, and
protrudes from twelve to twenty-four
inches. The range of this Dolphin
seems to be restricted to the Arctic
Ocean and the north of the Atlantic,
but it is known to make regular migrations
a considerable distance south of
it. Occasionally it appears on the
coast of Great Britain. Cuttlefish, Mollusks,
and small fry compose its
food.</p>

<p>Kuekenthal declares that its diving
powers are remarkable; 300 fathoms
of line were taken off by a harpooned
Bottle-nose which remained forty-five
minutes under water. They swim
with such extraordinary speed that
they not only follow the course of the
swiftest steamer with ease, but gambol
near it on their way, circling around
it at will, and without being left
behind. Occasionally one of them
jerks himself up into the air, and,
turning a somersault, falls noiselessly
back into the water and hurriedly
resumes his former position.</p>

<p>Several years ago we saw a school of
Dolphins swimming and frolicking in
the East River on the way from New
York Bay to Long Island Sound.
They seemed to us like gigantic
Swine, their motions being similar to
those that precipitated themselves,
according to the New Testament,
into the sea. They are very interesting
to watch, and travelers find great
pleasure in their company in crossing
the ocean. Sometimes a small school
of Dolphins will play about the ship
for days at a time, affording constant
amusement to the spectators.</p>

  NEW CHAMPION FOR THE SPARROW.</h2>


<p>The Sparrow has found an unexpected
champion in the Prime Minister
of France. The farmers have recently
been agitating in favor of the extermination
of the little bird, and succeeded
so far that a decree was submitted to
Premier Meline for signature, giving
orders for the destruction of the bird
throughout the country by all available
means. Before giving his sanction to
the measure the Prime Minister
determined to make an investigation,
in the course of which he has received
so much information in favor of the
birds, especially from the Forestry
Department, that he has not only
refused to sign the decree, but has
announced that he is about to take
steps to promote the increase of the
species in consequence of its usefulness.
It seems that the harm they do
to the crops is more than counterbalanced
by the benefits which they
confer in destroying the Caterpillars,
Worms, and other insects that are so
detrimental to trees.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that the matter
of the usefulness or noxiousness of this
little bird cannot be settled finally by
those vested with authority to act. It
is either beneficial or a pest. We think
it is both, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The organs of smell in a Vulture
and a Carrion Crow are so keen that
they can scent their food for a distance
of forty miles, so they say.</p>

<p>The wings of birds are not only to
aid locomotion in the air, but also on
the ground and water. One bird even
has claws in the "elbows" of its
wings to aid in climbing.</p>

<p>The Elephant does not smell with
his trunk. His olfactory nerves are
contained in a single nostril, which is
in the roof of the mouth, near the
front.</p>

<p>Humming Birds are domesticated
by placing in their cages a number of
paper flowers of tubular form, containing
a small quantity of sugar and
water, which must be frequently
renewed. Of this liquid the birds
partake and quickly become apparently
contented with their captivity.</p>

<p>Rightly considered, a Spider's web
is a most curious as well as a most
beautiful thing. When we were children,
the majority of us supposed that
the Spider's web was pulled out of its
mouth, and that the little insect had a
large reel of the stuff in his stomach,
and that he could almost instantly add
feet, yards, or rods to the roll. The
facts are that Spiders have a regular
spinning machine&mdash;a set of tiny tubes
at the far end of the body&mdash;and that
the threads are nothing more nor less
than a white, sticky fluid, which
hardens as soon as it comes in contact
with the air. The Spider does not
really and truly "spin," but begins a
thread by pressing his "spinneret"
against some object, to which the
liquid sticks. He then moves away
and by constantly ejecting the fluid
and allowing it to harden, forms his
ropes or wonderful geometrical nets.</p>

<p>Birds have separate notes of warning
to indicate whether danger is in
the shape of a Hawk or a Cat or a
man. If a Cat, a Hawk, or an Owl is on
the move, the Birds, especially Blackbirds,
always utter a clattering note,
constantly repeated, and Chickens
have a special sound to indicate the
presence of a Hawk. But when disturbed
by man the Blackbirds have
quite a different sound of alarm and
the Chickens also.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE birds nest in colonies,
the family consisting of about
thirty species, nearly all found
in the northern parts of the
northern hemisphere. Audubon is
said to have procured the specimen
figured by him at the mouth of the
Kennebec river, Maine, the only record
of its occurrence on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>The Tufted Puffin breeds upon the
rocks and in the Rabbit warrens near
the sea, finding the ready-made burrows
of the Rabbit very convenient for the
reception of its egg, and fighting with
the owner for the possession of its
burrow. Where Rabbits do not exist,
the Puffin digs its own burrows, and
works hard at its labor. The egg is
generally placed several feet within
the holes, and the parent defends it
vigorously.</p>

<p>Like most of the sea birds, both
sexes assist in incubation, says a recent
writer, referring to the birds found at
the famous rookery in the open sea two
hundred miles west of Fort Wrangell,
an island often visited by the Indians
for birds and eggs, and are close sitters,
a great amount of probing with a long
stick being necessary to dislodge them.
A grassy hill side is a favorite retreat
and here it is dangerous to travel about
on account of the Puffins constantly
coming blindly out of their dark holes
with a force sufficient to upset one if
fairly struck by the flying birds.
When specimens are wanted they are
easily captured with snares set over
their holes during the night. The
vari-colored pear-shaped eggs are well
known and make good eating.</p>

<p>The Farrallones are the home of
vast numbers of Puffins, as well as
other sea-birds, though less numerous
than formerly. The nests have been
robbed for the eggs to an extent that
threatened their extermination until a
recent law was enacted for their protection.
A portion of the island is a
veritable rookery, the grotesque birds
standing guard all about the rocks.
They are very awkward on land,
moving with a comical waddling stride,
but on the wing are graceful, rapid
flyers. They dive and swim with
ease, pursuing the fish in the water,
which, with crustaceans and insects,
constitutes their food.</p>

<p>The Farrallones have become largely
known from the wholesale collection
of the eggs of sea birds for market
purposes. As they nest chiefly in
colonies, the eggs therefore being
numerous, it has been, hitherto, a
considerable industry. The eggers
starting together soon separate to cover
their various routes over the cliffs, the
birds appearing in rows all over the
hill side. "As an egger climbs his
familiar trail toward the birds, a
commotion becomes apparent among
them. They jostle their neighbors
about the uneven rocks and now and
then with open bills utter a vain protest
and crowd as far as possible from
the intruder without deserting their
eggs. But they do not stay his progress
and soon a pair, then a group, and
finally, as the fright spreads, the whole
vast rookery take wing toward the
ocean. Instantly the Western Gulls
congregate with their hollow <i>kock-kock-ka</i>
and shrill cries adding to the din,
to secure their share of the booty, and
the egger must then work rapidly to
secure the eggs."</p>

<p class="bq">[This is the title of an article from the <i>London Telegraph</i>, which is so
well written, and is so interesting that we cannot deny ourselves the privilege of making
liberal extracts from it..]&mdash;<i>Ed.</i></p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">NATURALISTS have recently
been discussing the interesting
question whether or not
Bees can talk with
each other. Those
best informed on the subject are, we
gather, inclined to regard it as perfectly
possible. Such a view would,
perhaps, astonish many minds not
familiar with these and others of the
lower creatures by daily observation.
Yet the more people live in close
notice of animals and insects the less
inclined they will feel to draw that
very difficult line which divides
instinct from reason, or to set any hard
and fast limit to the wonders of
Nature. In fact, the very word
"lower" becomes sometimes an insult,
a positive affront to the wonderful life
about us, which even proud Man himself
has scarcely a right to offer.
There could, for instance, be nothing
well conceived humbler than the
Earthworm. Until the illustrious
Darwin took up the subject of that
despised being no one comprehended
the vastness of man's debt to this poor,
ugly, trampled creature. The numberless
millions of that obscure tribe, none
the less, have created all the loam and
all the arable land of the whole globe,
passing through their bodies the fallen
leaves and decaying vegetable matter;
and by their single sphere of labor in
this respect rendering cultivation and
harvests possible. When we tread on
that Worm we destroy an agricultural
laborer of the most respectable class.
To those eternal and widespread toils
of the creeping friend of men we owe
the woods, the meadows, and the
flowers. This is, of course, only an
example of the importance, not of the
faculties of the lower creatures.</p>

<p>Nevertheless even Worms communicate
sufficiently to have and to observe
their seasons of love; and Bees are so
much higher in the scale of life, and
so richly gifted in all details of their
work, and so sociable in their habits,
that it would not be at all a safe thing
to say they possess no means of intercourse.
Certainly no skillful and
watchful bee-master would ever venture
upon such an assertion. He
knows very well how the sounds in
the hive and those produced by individual
Bees vary from time to time,
and in a manner which appears to
convey, occasionally at all events,
mutual information. A Wasp or a
strange Bee entering a hive without
permission seems mighty quickly to
hear something not very much to its
advantage, and when two or three
Bees have found a good source of
honey, how on earth do all the others
know which path to take through the
trackless air, except by some friendly
buzz or wing-hint? Now, the bee-masters
tell us that there is surely one
particular moment in the history of
the hive when something very much
like actual language appears to be
obviously employed. It is when the
young queen is nearly ready to move
away. She begins to utter a series of
faint, staccato, piping noises, quite
different from her ordinary note, and
just before she flies off this sound
becomes altered to a low, delicate kind
of whistle, as if emanating from some
tiny fairy flute. How this small cry,
or call, or signal, is produced nobody
understands. The major portion of
sounds in a hive is, of course, caused
by the vibration more or less rapidly
of the wings of the Bees. But whoever
has examined the delicate machinery
with which the Grass-hopper makes
his chirp would not be surprised to
find that the queen Bee had also some
peculiar contrivance by which to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
deliver what may be called the royal
speech on the one or two great and
signal occasions of her exemplary life.</p>

<p>We should, however, confine the
subject in the boundary of far too
close a fancy if it were imagined that
sound was the only way in which
speech and intercourse may pass
among these humble creatures. Human
beings naturally gather up that
idea by living themselves in an atmosphere
of which they agitate the waves
for objects of mutual communication.
No scientific Bee or highly educated
Ant, if such creatures were possible,
seeing and hearing men and women
talk to each other, would dream that
they could equally well exchange
thoughts by making marks upon
paper, or send their messages of love
and business by seas and lands through
a quivering wire. Nay, if report is to
be believed, we are soon to be able to
transmit, at a flash over long distances,
a face, a map, a plan, a picture, a
whole page of a newspaper, or an
actual scene. As, therefore, those
lower creatures, if they indeed could
hear us speak, would have no notion
of how we make the air waves into
words, and still less grasp knowledge
of any subtler form among human
intercourse, so it is not quite safe for
man to think and call all these strange
families of the silent world alike dumb,
or to despise them for being free of
grammars and dictionaries. As a matter
of fact, it is obvious that some power
of mutual communication assuredly
comes to all creatures that live in
societies. Nobody can watch the flight
of a flock of birds, the behavior of a
herd of cattle, or, lower down, the
marvelous accommodations for common
existence of the small creeping
and flying things, without perceiving
that they know each other's minds in
some way or other in a very satisfactory
manner. Evidently there is, to begin
with, a common language&mdash;a <i>lingua
franca</i>&mdash;of the fields and of the forests.
All sportsmen know how the particular
cry of a frightened bird will put all
the wild animals on the alert who
would otherwise quite disregard the
bird's ordinary note. And the evil
success with which poachers can
imitate the cries of love and defiance
from denizens of the woodlands, proves
that its inhabitants possess a vocabulary
which can be stolen.</p>

<p>But, who, in truth, loving Dogs and
Cats and such-like humble friends ever
can doubt their high intelligence and
the strong and clear significance
attaching to certain among their
habitual utterances? Even London
cab and cart Horses, though they
cannot&mdash;fortunately for some among
us&mdash;speak, grow to understand the few
invariable words of direction which
their drivers address to them. In the
inferior orders of life there are doubtless
many other methods of intercourse,
and almost certainly there exists a
plain and very useful language of
touch. Nobody can read the delightful
researches of Sir John Lubbock
into the habits and customs of Ants
without feeling persuaded that those
little beings transact their business
perfectly well by touching each other's
antennæ. When Ants meet, a rapid
passage of these wonderful organs
takes place, gliding like rapiers above
and below, and this quickly informs
them whether they be friends or
enemies, which is the nearest respective
road home, whether any food is to be
procured nigh at hand, and what is
the general news in the formicatory
world. Truly it would be more desirable
to learn what Bees talk about
rather than to discuss the problem
whether they talk at all. The views
of Bees upon the purposes and colors
of flowers, upon the moral duties of
frugality and loyalty, and as to the
real meaning and lovliness of a Rose,
would be worth hearing. Of this much
we may be all assured, that the little
things of the world evade our knowledge
as much and are quite as marvelous
as the very largest and highest.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BUTTERFLY" id="THE_BUTTERFLY"></a>THE BUTTERFLY.</h2>

<p class="ac"><span class="sc">By Emily C. Thompson.</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="48" height="100"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN THE western part of England
if the first Butterfly you see in
the spring is white and if you
succeed in killing this Butterfly,
good luck will surely come
to you. Some gentlemen on their way
to church one day saw a friend dashing
down the road wildly brandishing a
cane. He could not stop to explain.
He was as a rule a sedate, calm man,
so this excitement alarmed them. As
nothing could be done, they went on
their way and soon met the father of
their friend, an old man who usually
hobbled painfully along on two canes.
He too was excited and was doing his
best to make his way down the road
with only one cane. His first words
were, "I'm afraid he has missed it."
"Missed what?" thought the gentlemen,
and finally after many efforts to quiet
him enough for conversation learned
from the old man that his son had
seen his first butterfly, that it was
white and that without more ado he
had snatched his old father's cane and
set off in pursuit. Still the old man
was perfectly willing to hobble along
as best he could, if only good luck and
prosperity could be procured by the
slaughter of the pretty little insect.
The color of its wings is due to what
seems to us a fine dust scattered
over them, but in reality this dust is
made up of little discs fastened by
stalks to the wings, arranged usually
in rows somewhat like the shingles on
a house.</p>

<p>Notice its two great round eyes and
remember that each of these is composed
of thousands of perfect little
eyes. Its trunk you will find coiled
up under its head and sometimes this
Butterfly of ours completes its toilet
by opening its trunk and cleaning it.
By the antennæ of the Butterfly you
can tell it from, the Moth, for those of
the former are immovable and furnished
with knobs, while those of the
other have not the knobs and can be
stowed away under the wings. If you
wish to distinguish the Butterfly from
the Moth, remember this fact, and also
that Butterflies fly only in the daytime
and always rest with the wings erect.
These facts are trustworthy, for no
Moth has ever been found to possess
all three of these characteristics,
though some do possess one or two.</p>

<p>Though curious in itself, its life
history is still more curious. Man, in
passing through his seven ages never
loses the distinguishing characteristics
which make him a man, but our Butterfly
as it passes through its three
ages changes so much that we seem,
while studying it to be studying three
distinct creatures&mdash;the Caterpillar, the
Chrysalis, and the Butterfly.</p>

<p>In the Caterpillar our dainty little
fairy presents itself as it appears in
its first stage, having just spent a few
days, or a month, or perhaps the whole
winter in the egg. It changes its old
skin many times during its Caterpillar
life of twenty or thirty days, at each
change gaining in weight and brilliancy,
until with the last it appears as
a Chrysalis "a legless, mummy-like
creature," which maintains its suspended
position by means of the hooks
on its tail or by a silken girth around
its body. A few days before the Butterfly
comes forth, it can be seen
through the thin cases. Finally the
skin on the back bursts open and the
little insect is free. For a few minutes
it stands with drooping wings.
Gradually the wings distend and in a
short while reach four times their
original size. Then our Butterfly
hastens away to carry its joyful
greeting to man and flower. So the
cycle of Butterfly life can thus be

Butterfly, Egg.</p>

<p>Why they migrate is not known but
evidence enough has been brought in
by eye witnesses to prove that this
does occur. One flight seen in Switzerland
lasted for two hours, the continuous
stream of insects being ten or
fifteen feet wide and made up of the
species called the Painted Lady. Similar
companies have been seen at sea, as
Mr. Darwin bears witness, also before
and after tornadoes in certain places.
In Ceylon a gentlemen drove through
a cloud of white Butterflies for nine
miles. But very interesting to us, is a
great migration recorded to have been
seen in our own country, in Massachusetts,
about Oct. 1, 1876. These are
strange stories, but really hardly more
strange than other facts about these
little animals, graceful and beautiful
in form and motion, whose very
presence adds greatly to the charm of
mother Nature.</p>

<p>Such quantities of eggs are laid by
the Butterflies that if certain animals
did not contend against them, man
would not be able to withstand the
ravages of the Caterpillar. Man has
one powerful ally in the birds
which devour enormous quantities of
these eggs, but a still more powerful
ally is the Ichneumon Fly. This little
insect is a parasite through its grub
state and chooses as its host either the
egg of the Butterfly or the Caterpillar.
The full grown Fly lays its egg by
means of an ovipositor, a sharp, hollow
instrument with which it can
pierce the skin or shell of its victim.
The eggs of the fly hatch and the
grubs feed upon the Caterpillar, but
usually do not touch upon its vital
parts until it is full grown, then they
devour them and within the skin of
their former host form their own
cocoons. Sometimes they wait until
the Caterpillar assumes its Chrysalis
state before they finish their dread
work, then much to the surprise of
interested beholders, a little cluster of
flies appears at the breaking of the
cocoon, and no beautiful Butterfly.</p>

<p>Some of these brightly colored little
messengers of gladness live through
the winter. Usually they pass this
trying period wrapped warmly in the
cocoon or nestled under some leaf, still
a Chrysalis; but a few species weather
the cold and the snow and, shut up in
some hollow tree or some empty shed,
sleep away the happy days of Jack
Frost and Santa Claus and are ready
to awake with the spring, when they
are not abashed in their bedraggled
garments to appear among their
brothers, who come forth brightly
clad, fresh from the soft, warm resting
place of the cocoon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the marvelous migration of
Butterflies which occurred on Oct. 3,
1898, will be more interesting to us than
those already mentioned because it
happened so recently and in our own
country, and perhaps, most of all, because
the reason for flight is hazarded.
The inhabitants of Wichita, Kansas, at
3:15 o'clock in the afternoon of that day
were greeted with the sight of many
Butterflies flying south. Gradually
the number increased until business
practically ceased, the inhabitants all
turning out to view the brilliant spectacle.
The stream of yellow and
brown insects, with the accompanying
purr and brilliant effects of fluttering
wings flowed on until within a half an
hour of sunset, and even after this,
millions of stragglers hastened southward.
But you are interested in the
reason given? They say that our
little friends were driven away from
their customary haunts by the forest
fires in Colorado. This is only one
more supposition to add to the list
already awaiting some enterprising
student, who shall at last solve the
mystery of these wonderful flights and
fully acquaint us with all the other
interesting facts which our little Butterflies
are still keeping secret.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ARMADILLO" id="THE_ARMADILLO"></a>THE ARMADILLO.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_a.jpg" width="100" height="84"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ALL Armadillos bear the name
Fatu in the South American
Guarau Indian language.
Although the name is of
Spanish origin the Indian
term Fatu has also been adopted
in European languages, except in the
single case of the six-banded species.
They are all of more or less similar
appearance and habits. They are
natives of the southern American
belt, extending as far north as Mexico,
and the specimen presented here was
taken in Texas, where it is occasionally
found. The Armadillos are at
home in sparsely grown and sandy
plains, and in fields on the edges of
woods, which, however, they never enter.
During the breeding season they consort
together, but at all other times
lead solitary lives and show no regard
for any living thing except as it may
serve for food.</p>

<p>Singular as it may appear, Armadillos
do not have a regular abiding
place, and they frequently change
their homes. They can dig a hole in
the ground five or six feet deep with
such expedition that they are able to
have several places of retreat. The
hole is circular, at the entrance from
eight to twenty-four inches wide, and
at the bottom is a snug chamber large
enough for them to turn around in.
They are great night rovers and seldom
move about by daylight, the glaring
sunlight dazing them. When seen
during the day it is always in rainy
weather when the sky is overcast. It
has been shown that Armadillos excavate
their burrows under the hills of
Ants or Termites, where they are able
to gather their principal food with the
greatest convenience by day as well as
by night. Besides the foregoing they
eat Caterpillars, Lizards, and Earthworms
and are thus advantageous to
the husbandman. Plants also constitute
a part of their diet.</p>

<p>Armadillos are not agile but are
remarkably muscular. It is said, to
avoid their enemies they can cut their
way into the earth in places which a
hoe wielded by a strong man can
pierce with difficulty. The Fatu
needs only three minutes to drive a
tunnel exceeding the length of its own
body. The strongest man is incapable
of pulling it out by the tail. Once in
its hole, it is always secure from Dogs.
When it is seized by Dogs, it never
defends itself in any way. This is
probably not from cowardice, but because
it believes itself secure from
danger.</p>

<p>Best of all, the Armadillo is a useful
animal. The Indians are fond of
nearly all the species. While it has
an unpleasant odor of musk, it can be
prepared for the table; and some think
it one of the most palatable of dishes.
One of the species can roll itself into
a ball, which, however, it does only in
extremity.</p>

<p>In captivity Armadillos are usually
put in cages with Monkeys, who, if
they do not precisely reduce them to
servitude, at least use them as playthings.
The Monkeys ride their backs
sportively, turn them over, without
the danger they might experience from
Turtles, who are less harmless, and
cause them no end of worry. The
Armadillo, with all his coat of mail,
has a fur lining on his belly, and
the experienced Dog quickly turns it
over and makes short work of the
apparently invulnerable quadruped.
The Dog quickly crunches the thin
armour and leaves the poor beast lifeless.
Only the powerful digging claws
which might, one would think, be
used in his own defense, remain to tell
the tale of the only means which nature
has seemed to provide him with against
his enemies.</p>

<p class="ac">(THE YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT.)</p>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS bird comedian is an actor,
a mimic, and a ventriloquist;
he has been called "a
rollicking polygot," "an eccentric
acrobat," "a happy-go-lucky
clown, turning aerial somersaults," "a
Punchinello among birds," and from
my own experience I can add that he
is a practical joker and "an artful
dodger." His voice is absolutely
unique in its range. Besides his
power as a ventriloquist, to throw it in
any direction, and so entice away from
his nest any intruder upon his domain,
he possesses the most unequaled capacity
for making queer noises. On a
certain summer day I was driving to
Monticello, the Virginia home of President
Jefferson, along a beautiful road,
bordered by tall trees and a thick,
leafy undergrowth where a thousand
nests might be safely hidden. All
along a road the Chats called <i>chit</i>, <i>chit</i>,
or barked, whined, clucked, whistled,
sang, chuckled and called overhead,
or out of the bushes beside us, always
invisible, or just giving a flutter to the
leaves to show their presence. One of
the party declared one called <i>Kitty</i>,
<i>Kitty!</i> distinctly, and he also mimmicked
a puppy most successfully.
Later on, in July, I was stopping near
a favorite haunt of the Chats; a country
place on the edge of the woods, where
thickly growing shrubs and bushes
filled the deep hollows between the
hills and near the streams. Here they
had their broods, and not only all day,
but late in the evening by moonlight
they could be heard, making the whole
place ring with their medley of sounds,
while not a feather of them could be
seen.</p>

<p>Yet I finally succeeded in catching
various glimpses of them, and in
equally characteristic, though different
moods. First, I saw them darting rapidly
to and fro on foraging journeys,
their bills filled with food, for they are
most admirable husbands and fathers,
and faithful to the nests that they hide
with such care. They are beautiful
birds, rich olive-green above and a
bright yellow below, with two or three
pure white lines or stripes about the
eye and throat and a "beauty spot"
of black near the beak. I watched
one balancing on a slender twig near
the water in the bright sunshine and
his colors, green and gold, fairly glittered.
His nest is usually near the
ground in the crotch of a low branch
and is a rather large one, woven of
bark in strips, coarse grass and leaves,
and lined with finer grass for the three
or four white eggs, adorned with small
reddish-brown spots. One pair had
their home near a blackberry thicket,
and they might be seen gobbling berries
and peeping at you with bright
black eyes all the while.</p>

<p>The Chat excels in extraordinary
and absurd pose; wings fluttering, tail
down, legs dangling like a Stork, he
executes all kinds of tumbles in the
air. It is said that a Chat courtship
is a sight never to be forgotten by the
lucky spectator. Such somersaults,
such songs, such queer jerks and starts.
Our bird is one of the Wood Warbler
family, a quiet and little known group
of birds. His elusiveness and skill
in hiding, and his swift movements,
are his only traits in common with
them.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED-HEAD_DUCK" id="THE_RED-HEAD_DUCK"></a>THE RED-HEAD DUCK.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_i.jpg" width="48" height="100"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN MANY points of structure and
habits Sea Ducks, of which this
is a specimen, may be distinguished
from Fresh Water
Ducks by the presence of a lobe
or little flap of skin on the lower side of
the hind toe. The legs of the former
are also placed farther behind, and
they are thus better fitted for swimming,
though not so well adapted for
walking or running on land. The
feathers of Sea Ducks are more dense
also, and they are all provided with a
quantity of thick down next to the
skin, which is of no small commercial
value.</p>

<p>The difference in the habits of the
two species is no less striking. The
latter dive for their food, which the
former never do; they are chiefly
maritime in their distribution, although
all, or nearly all, retire to fresh
water lakes to raise their young.</p>

<p>The Red-head is said not to be
common along the coast of New England,
but in the winter months is
found in considerable numbers along
the south shore of Long Island. It is
extremely abundant south of that
point, and particularly so in Chesapeake
Bay, where immense numbers
are killed each season. Where it is
enabled to feed on the well known
wild celery its flesh is said to be fully
equal in flavor to that of the Canvas
Back. Both in spring and fall it is
an extremely abundant migrant in the
Western States. It generally reaches
northern Illinois, says Hallock, in its
spring passage about the last of March,
remaining until the latter part of April.
On its return journey late in October,
it remains on the rivers, lakes, and
sloughs until the cold weather, by
freezing up its feeding grounds, forces
it to go farther south. It is altogether
probable that a few of these birds
breed in the Rocky Mountain regions
within the limits of the United States,
but they usually continue northward
to their regular breeding grounds,
which extend from Wisconsin, Michigan,
and others of the northern tier of
states, to the fur countries.</p>

<p>The Red-head was found nesting on
the St. Clair Flats, Michigan, by Mr.
W. H. Collins, who, in describing
some of its breeding habits, says: "I
had the good fortune to find two nests
of this bird containing respectively
seven and eight eggs. The first was
placed on some drifted rushes on a
sunken log, and was composed of flags
and rushes evidently taken from the
pile of drift upon the log, as they were
short pieces, so short, in fact, that the
nest when lifted with the hands fell
in pieces. The nest was four inches
deep and lined with down from the
female. This nest contained seven
fresh eggs of a creamy color, varied in
measurements and of a uniform oval
shape, very little smaller at one end.
The other nest was built similar to a
Coot's nest; that is, of flags and grass
interwoven at the base of a bunch of
flags growing in water three or four
feet deep. It was built in such a way
that the nest would rise and fall with
the water."</p>

<p>The food of the Red-head consists
of mollusks, shell-fish, and the seeds
and roots of aquatic plants.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRDS_IN_GARDEN_AND_ORCHARD" id="BIRDS_IN_GARDEN_AND_ORCHARD"></a>
  BIRDS IN GARDEN AND ORCHARD.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_d.jpg" width="100" height="94"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">DURING the last year I have
received quite a number of
letters from all over the
United States, inquiring
why so few birds are
found about the homes, among the
ornamental shrubs and trees, and in
the orchard. My correspondents also
wish to know how our beautiful native
songsters can be induced to take up
their residence in the neighborhood of
man. As the many inquiries came
from the East, the West, the North,
and the South, I shall treat the subject
in the following manner:</p>

<p>The northern, eastern, and central
states show but little difference as to
their bird-life, and there is also little
diversity in regard to the ornamental
trees and shrubs of the gardens. The
region included is bounded on the
the north by the British possessions,
on the east by the Atlantic ocean, on
the west by the Rocky mountains, and
on the south by the Indian Territory,
Arkansas, Tennessee, and North
Carolina. While living in the country
I have always had birds at my home
and in the neighborhood, and I shall,
therefore, give my own experience.</p>

<p>Birds settle only where they find
the surroundings perfectly congenial,
and where they are protected and
consequently feel safe; where dense
shrubbery, evergreens, and deciduous
trees abound, and where
water and suitable nesting material
are near at hand. In one garden
they are exceedingly numerous,
while in another one close by, only a
few pairs, perhaps, are to be found.
When protected, they soon learn to
regard man as their friend. Their
enemies, especially Cats, Squirrels, and
Owls, must not be allowed to rove
about in the garden and orchard, and
such thieves and robbers as the Blue
Jay, the Loggerhead Shrike or Butcher
Bird, and that abominable tramp and
anarchist among birds, the English
Sparrow, should never be tolerated in
a garden or park where other birds are
expected to make their homes.</p>

<p>In the days of my boyhood the
groves re-echoed with the songs of
many birds; the woods, however, have
been cleared away, and in the poor
remnants of the once magnificent
forests there are few birds to be found
today. The sweet notes of the Veery,
the thundering sounds of the Ruffed
Grouse, the loud hammering of the
Pileated Woodpecker, are no longer
heard. I have devoted much time to
erecting bird houses and planting
ornamental trees and shrubs for the
accommodation of the birds. Here
they soon took up their residences.
On the top of the barn and granary
Martin boxes were placed, and in the
gables of the barn holes were cut to
admit the pretty Barn Swallow and the
Ph&oelig;be. Among the first birds to settle
were the Robins and Bluebirds, both
heralds of spring, appearing in the last
days of March or early in April from
their winter homes in our Southern
States. The Baltimore Oriole suspended
its beautiful hanging nest from
a high horizontal branch of a Walnut
tree. The Cedar Bird, quiet and
retired in its habits, and a most beautiful
denizen of the garden, placed its
nest constructed of sheep's wool on a
low horizontal branch of an Oak. The
sprightly Canary-like song of the
American Goldfinch, often called the
Wild Canary, was heard throughout
the summer, and its cozy little nest,
lined warmly with thistle-down, was
placed in the upright exterior branches
of a Sugar Maple. In the same tree,
but lower down on a horizontal branch
the exquisite pendulous nest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Red-eyed Vireo was now and then
found. This Vireo is an incessant
songster as it gleans among the upper
branches of the trees.</p>

<p>The Rose-breasted Grosbeak invariably
nested in a clump of dense wild
Crab-apple trees, partly overgrown
with grape vines. Another inhabitant
of the grove not easily overlooked, is
the bold Kingbird, the guardian of the
barnyard, its nest saddled on a rather
strong moss-covered limb of another
Oak. I could mention a number of
other birds that build their nests near
the dwellings of man, but space will
not permit me to do so. I will add,
however, that if my readers would
have about them these beautiful and
useful birds, which are almost the best
friends of mankind, don't allow English
Sparrows to come near your home,
and you will soon find yourself in the
midst of the songsters. The incredible
numbers of English Sparrows now
found almost everywhere have driven
our native birds away.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CONSTANTINOPLE has one
grace and gayety peculiar to
itself, that comes from an
infinite number of birds
of every kind, for
which the Turks nourish a warm
sentiment and regard. Mosques, groves,
old walls, gardens, palaces all resound
with song, the whistling and twittering
of birds; everywhere wings are
fluttering and life and harmony abound.
The sparrows enter the houses boldly,
and eat out of women's and children's
hands, Swallows nest over the café
doors, and under the arches of the
bazaars; Pigeons in innumerable
swarms, maintained by legacies from
sultans and private individuals, form
garlands of black and white along the
cornices of the cupolas and around the
terraces of the minarets; Sea-gulls dart
and play over the water; thousands of
Turtle-doves coo amorously among the
cypresses in the cemeteries; Crows
croak about the Castle of the Seven
Towers; Halcyons come and go in long
files between the Black Sea and the
Sea of Marmora; and Storks sit upon
the cupolas of the mausoleums. For
the Turk, each one of these birds has
a gentle meaning, or a benignant
virtue: Turtle-doves are favorable to
lovers, Swallows keep away fire from
the roofs where they build their nests,
Storks make yearly pilgrimage to
Mecca, Halcyons carry the souls of the
faithful to Paradise. Thus he protects
and feeds them, through a sentiment
of gratitude and piety; and they
enliven the house, the sea, and the
sepulchre. Every quarter of Stamboul
is full of the noise of them, bringing
to the city a sense of the pleasures of
country life, and continually relishing
the soul with a reminder of nature.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>There are several kinds of animals,
points out Cosmos, that have never
swallowed water. Among these are
the Lamas of Patagonia and certain
Gazelles of the far east, and a considerable
number of reptiles&mdash;Serpents,
Lizards, and certain Batrachians&mdash;that
live and flourish where there is no
moisture. A kind of Mouse of the arid
plains of western America also exists
where moisture is said to be unknown.
In the London Zoological Gardens a
Paroquet lived fifty-two years without
drinking a drop, and some naturalists
believe that Hares take no liquid
except the dew that sometimes forms
on the grass they eat. Even Cows and
Goats in France, in the neighborhood
of the Lozère, almost never drink, yet
they produce the milk from which is
made the famous Roquefort cheese.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE of our poets is authority
for the statement that
"music hath power to sooth
the savage breast," but experiments
have recently
been made in Lincoln Park, Chicago,
<i>The American Naturalist</i> tells us, to
determine with scientific accuracy the
effects of violin playing on certain
animals.</p>

<p>"Music which was slow and sweet,
like 'Home, Sweet Home' or 'Annie
Laurie,' pleased the Panthers, a Jaguar,
and a Lioness with her cubs. The
Panthers became nervous and twitched
their tails when a lively jig, 'The Irish
Washerwoman,' was played to them,
and relapsed into their former quiet
when the music again became soothing.</p>

<p>"The Jaguar was so nervous during
the jig music that he jumped from a
shelf to the floor of his cage and back
again. When the player ceased playing
and walked away, the Jaguar
reached out his paw to him as far as
he could. His claws were drawn back.</p>

<p>"The Lioness and her cubs were
interested from the first, though when
the violinist approached the cage the
mother gave a hiss, and the cubs hid
behind her. At the playing of a lively
jig, the cubs stood up on their hind
legs and peeped over at the player.
When the musician retreated from the
cage, the animals came to the front of
it and did not move back when he
gradually drew so near as almost to
touch the great paws which were
thrust through the bars. When playing
'Home, Sweet Home,' the entire
family seemed very attentive, and
were motionless except that the cubs
turned their heads from side to side.
Then another jig was played and the
cubs pranced about."</p>

<p>"The Coyotes in a den, squatted in
a semicircle, and sat silently while the
music continued. When it ceased,
they ran up and pawed at the player
through the bars. He began afresh,
and they again formed in a silent semicircle.
This experiment was tried
several times with the same results."</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Of late years the Sea Gulls have
found it so much to their interest to
come up to the Thames in our midst
that their graceful evolutions around
the crowded bridges in ever growing
flocks has almost ceased to excite
notice. But this year, as never before,
they have descended upon the water
of St. James Park in such great numbers
that their presence must considerably
exercise the minds of those
responsible for the welfare of the other
wild fowl there. They may be seen
sometimes resting upon the surface of
the eastern half of the lake in sufficient
number almost to hide the water.
And at the luncheon hour, when released
workers throng bank and bridge,
bestowing upon the water the scanty
fragments of their frugal meals, the
gulls, on ready wing, with an agility
born of long practice over stormy seas,
give the clumsier Ducks and Geese
hard work to obtain even a small
share of what is going. Not so long
ago a piece of plain bread might often
float uneaten until it sank waterlogged
for the benefit of the fish. It is so no
longer. No crumb now goes a-begging
